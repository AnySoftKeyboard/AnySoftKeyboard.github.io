## General Information

Menny Even-Danan, the copyright holder of AnySoftKeyboard, provides this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use and disclose information, including personal information that you may provide to us or that we may obtain as AnySoftKeyboard is used. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time, so please check back with us periodically.

**"Personal Information"** includes information that alone or when in combination with other information may be used to readily identify, contact, or locate you or a specific individual.

## Collected Information and Usage

By using AnySoftKeyboard, you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Information by AnySoftKeyboard consistent with applicable data protection law and this Privacy Policy.

<div class="highlight-box">
<p><strong>We DO NOT share Personal Information</strong> (e.g., name, address, telephone number, email address, location, device ID, contacts and personal device's user-dictionary), and we <strong>DO NOT transfer</strong> this Personal Information from your device, or AnySoftKeyboard's storage, to any third party or external device.</p>
</div>

AnySoftKeyboard collects and uses information from you in several ways:

- **Word Learning:** Typing behavior is tracked and used to learn new words you use that are not in AnySoftKeyboard pre-built words dictionary. This Personal Information is stored on the device and is not transferred by AnySoftKeyboard to any other device or third party.
- **Predictions:** Typing behavior is also tracked and used to predict which words you commonly use after other words (bi-grams).
- **Contacts:** Your contacts list is read to help AnySoftKeyboard predict typing and correct typing. You may disable this feature in the Setup process of AnySoftKeyboard or in the settings.

## When AnySoftKeyboard May Share Collected Information

**Never.**

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If in the future we change our Privacy Policy, we will post the new Privacy Policy on this Website and Application (as an app update). We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy in the future. Your continued use of AnySoftKeyboard following a change in the Privacy Policy represents consent to the new Privacy Policy to the fullest extent permitted by law. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy.

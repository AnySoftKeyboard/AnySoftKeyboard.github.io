<h2>Pre-Releases</h2>
<p>AnySoftKeyboard has a stable release every few months. The stable release comes after a long period of development and testing and usually is very stable.
This stability comes as a result of good amount of unit-tests and manual testing done by volunteering users. We rely heavily on these volunteers to ensure any new feature is bug free and existing functionaity is intact.</p>
<p>If you wish to help and test a pre-release version of AnySoftKeyboard, you have a few options:
<ul>
 <li>Alpha-Channel: This channel will be deployed with <i>every</i> code change. This means you'll might get a new release every day.</li>
 <li>Beta-Channel: This channel will be deployed every Wednesday morning. Usually, this is much more stable than the alpha channel.</li>
</ul>
</p>
